# Neural Relational Inference

This is the template repository for the Multimodal Graph Learning project using the Functional Transcriptomics Team datasets for the 2024 AIND Summer Internship.

# Project Description

The repository hosts project tracking and code used to train, test, and validate a state-of-the-art deep learning model for the joint prediction of behavior and in vivo physiological recordings.

Recent advancements in analyzing simultaneous recordings of animal behavior and brain physiology illustrate that movement dominates much of cortical single-trial activity and shapes fluctuations in functional connectivity. Morever, specific synaptic connectivity patterns can be linked to transcriptomically defined subclasses. Thus a major goal of this project is to develop a deep learning pipeline that bridges time-varying behavior, population dynamics, and functional connectivity to determine whether functional-types (defined by cell-specific dynamics and functional connectivity patterns) can be mapped to transcriptomic-types (at the subclass and/or supertype levels).

The project consists of training, optimization, and validation of a deep learning model using multiple sources of behavioral data in addition to neural activity from the optical physiology and electrophysiology experimental pipelines at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics. The outcome of the internship will be a systematically tested deep learning model that can be used across the Instituteâ€™s multiple projects seeking to understand the neural correlates of behavior, sensory processing, and learning in addition to guiding future experimental design.

# Experimental datasets
This project will use previous released datasets in addition to newer unreleased datasets. An overview of the overall design of these datasets can be found in the [SWDB Data Book](https://allenswdb.github.io/intro.html).
